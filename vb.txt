sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER

In this command, sudo allows you to run commands with the security privileges of the superuser. usermod is a command-line utility that allows you to modify a user’s system account. The -a option tells usermod to add the user to the supplementary group(s). -G specifies the group name, in this case, ‘vboxusers’. $USER is a system variable that stands for the current user.

    After running this command, log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
    You can verify that you are in the ‘vboxusers’ group by running:

groups $USER

This command lists all the groups that the current user belongs to. Ensure ‘vboxusers’ is listed in the output.
